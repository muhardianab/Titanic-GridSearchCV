# Titanic-MachineLearning-GridSearchCV
Titanic Disaster Classification using GridSearchCV of various Model Machine Learning

Prediction of survivor using personal data of the passenger, here are the data/columns/features of the passenger:
1. Ticket class
2. Sex
3. Age in years	
4. siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
5. parents / children aboard the Titanic	
6. Ticket number	
7. Passenger fare	
8. Cabin number	
9. Port of Embarkation
10. Survival 

The Models to predict the passengers who are survive and the passengers who are not survive
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Naive Bayes classifier
5. Perceptron
6. Linear SVC
7. Stochastic Gradient Descent
8. Decision Tree
9. Random Forrest
10. XGBoost
11. AdaBoost
12. CatBoost
13. LightGBM
